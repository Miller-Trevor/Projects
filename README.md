SMSSecurePay: 
In a cash filled world, the cashless policy promotes the use of legal tenders and facilitates traceable transactions, which aids auditing and taxation. 
However, in societies that rely heavily on cash-based transactions such as street vending and retailing, implementing a cashless system may pose challenges.
To address this, we aim to create a "CASH APP" that leverages the widespread availability of mobile phones. 
The proposed product will ensure security through a series of unique text messages exchanged between the buyer and seller.
Additionally, it will allow transactions to occur across different currencies.
