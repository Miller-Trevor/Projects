Ecommerce Hat Store: 
As a project for our Web Development Class, 2 of my classmates and I created this ecommerce store to display our knowledge of React and Node.
The main product for the store was a variety of hats, from cowboy hates to propeller hats, in which you were able to select any amount of hats
and add them to your cart in real time. After you had all of your items in the cart you were able to mimic a payment using the StripeAPI which provides
internal card information to proceed with a successful transaction.
